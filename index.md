# DEF CON Academy

DEF CON is a siren song for the hacker mind. Clever people around the world hear it and are pulled, every year, to Las Vegas. They mass by the tens of thousands, streaming through the halls of DEF CON to watch talks given by absolute legends about incredible escapades, to gaze in wonder as true wizards bend bytes to their will in the CTF room, and to dream about one day reaching to those heights themselves.

Some have the critical combination of grit, perseverance, raw talent, and (let's face it) privilege to push through to those dreams of greatness. But among even the clever and the motivated, it is rare for n00bs to rise to l33tness without support. Some find this support in inspiring classes in college. Others, among friends or mentors. But many don't find it at all, and remain in the hallways, dreaming.

Do you want to leave the hallways and hack the planet? We are hackers, educators, and learners who are creating DEF CON Academy, a concerted effort to maximize hacker potential by providing open, clear, approachable, and inclusive practical resources for budding hackers to transcend and rule cyberspace. Through extensive DEF CON event presence and year-round hacking resources, we will pro up the noobs of the world and bring the community, at scale, to the next level of skill.
